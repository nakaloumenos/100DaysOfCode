# 100DaysOfCode
Sharing my journey on becoming full stack

## What it is about
The rules of 100 days of Code are very simple:
1. Programming for at least 30 minutes - 1hour a day
2. Work as a developer doesn't count. It has to be for a personal project or personal development
3. Post somewhere to be held accountable (Instagram, Github, codepen...)
